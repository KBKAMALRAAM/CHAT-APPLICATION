**DOMAIN** : FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT

**BATCH DURATION** : NOVEMBER 8th, 2024 to DECEMBER 8th, 2024

**MENTOR NAME** :

This task required the creation of a live chat application using WebSocket or Socket.IO for real-time communication between the client and the server. 
The application allowed users to send and receive messages in real time, making it suitable for creating interactive chat applications. The primary
languages and technologies used were JavaScript (both client and server-side) and Node.js. Node.js was used to build the backend server, which listens 
for incoming messages from the client and sends them to the appropriate recipients. On the client side, JavaScript was used to handle events like sending
messages, displaying received messages, and connecting to the WebSocket server. Socket.IO, a popular library built on top of WebSocket, was used to simplify 
the implementation of real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and the client. Express.js, a web framework for Node.js, was used to set up 
the server, handle HTTP requests, and serve static files. This allowed for smooth integration between the frontend and backend, enabling seamless communication
between users in the chat application. The chat interface was built using HTML and CSS, ensuring it was intuitive and visually appealing. Users could interact 
with the application in real time, making it a practical and efficient solution for building modern chat systems.
